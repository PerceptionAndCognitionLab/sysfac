1. We propose a set of Bayesian hierarchical models for systems factorial technology that capture commonalities in architecture across individuals

2. We develop analysis including Bayes factor model-comparison algorithms

3. We investigate whether chunking in working memory changes processing architecture

4. We find that there is no difference in architecture across memory and perception tasks,  and find that participants all use the same processing architecture.
